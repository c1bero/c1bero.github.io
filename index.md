Hi, I am a former mathematician who turned into a security researcher. During my
PhD in Mathematics at the [FAU](https://www.fau.eu/) I was a member of the
Capture-The-Flag team [FAUST](https://faust.cs.fau.de/) and dived into the world
of IT security. After my PhD I was first working as an embedded software
developer for network interfaces at [Vector Informatik](https://www.vector.com)
and then joined [Secfault Security](https://secfault-security.com/) as a
Security Consultant. Now, I am working at
[Exodus Intelligence](https://exodusintel.com/) as a security researcher.

As I have learned so much from the community, I created this website to write
some blog posts and give the community something back. In particular, I added
links to the blog posts of Secfault Security I was involved in. Enjoy!
